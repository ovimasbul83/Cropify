Humidity: 80.37979919%
pH value: 5.706943251
Rainfall: 182.9043504 mm

The recommended crops are:

1. Rice: The temperature, humidity, and rainfall conditions are suitable for growing rice. However, the pH value is slightly on the acidic side, which may need to be adjusted for optimal rice cultivation.

2. Jute: The temperature, humidity, rainfall, and nutrient levels (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) are well-suited for growing jute, which is a fiber crop.

3. Cotton: The temperature and humidity conditions are favorable for cotton cultivation, which is another fiber crop. However, the pH value may need to be adjusted slightly towards a more neutral range for optimal growth.

4. Coffee: The temperature and rainfall conditions are suitable for growing coffee, which is a beverage crop. However, the humidity level is on the higher side, and the pH value is slightly acidic, which may need to be addressed.

To ensure a diverse range of crops, it is recommended to consider growing a combination of rice (grain), jute (fiber), and coffee (beverage crop). Additionally, incorporating legumes like chickpeas, kidney beans, or pigeon peas into the crop rotation can help improve soil fertility and provide additional nutritional benefits.

It is important to note that while the recommendations are based on the given environmental conditions, other factors such as soil quality, irrigation availability, and local agricultural practices should also be considered for successful crop cultivation."
